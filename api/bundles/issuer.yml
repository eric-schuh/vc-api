            The request could not be processed due to one of the following reasons:
                        - The provided value of 'issuer' does not match the expected configuration.
                        - Another condition that results in a Bad Request.

If provided, it MUST adhere to the configuration requirements of the particular implementation. Implementations MUST be able to understand and process the supplied value in accordance with their configuration. In scenarios where multiple configurations exist for a specific endpoint, the 'issuer' object, if present, MAY be utilized to select among multiple potential issuers. In such cases, the provided 'issuer' value MUST align with the available configurations, allowing the implementation to appropriately determine the issuer for the specific request. Implementations MUST ensure that the selected issuer aligns with their configuration and can be processed successfully.

            A URI that can be used to identify the credential, that can be used in APIs to refer to the issued verifiable credential. If credentialId is not provided by the issuer coordinator, the issuer service will auto-populate its value from credential.id. If neither credentialId nor credential.id is provided, it will not be possible to refer to this credential once issued nor to deal with errors of duplication. credentialId SHOULD NOT be set by the issuer coordinator if the credential.id property is set, nor should credentialId be used as a replacement for credential.id; rather, credentialId is a means of identifying a credential without the id property (i.e., credential.id) being set. The issuer service SHOULD NOT auto-generate a credentialId if one is not supplied by the issuer coordinator, because doing so could create a partitioning error if the result is never received by the client.

        credentialId: example.com/ad5d541f-db7a-4bff-97e1-d403ce403767
